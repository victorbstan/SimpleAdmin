## Description
A simple (one model) Rails Engine drop-in administration interface for your Rails project. 

## About
The motivation for this gem is to provide a simple to understand, easy to hack and extend administration interface for a traditional Rails/ActiveRecord project.

It has been build for and extracted from a real-world production project. Originally created as a `lib` it can now be installed into any project as a Rails Engine (gem).

## TODO
1. Write tests
